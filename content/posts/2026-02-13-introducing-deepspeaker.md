## A Daily Editorial Engine
DeepSpeaker is built as an automated editorial system. Each day, the pipeline collects public signals from chart activity, social discussion, and music press coverage, then identifies one artist with clear upward momentum.

## What Gets Published
The resulting post is written in a calm, informed tone with context over hype. It covers artist background, current momentum, sonic language, and practical listening recommendations.

## The Standard
No private APIs. No lyrics. No clickbait framing. Just one considered dispatch per day, published automatically.
